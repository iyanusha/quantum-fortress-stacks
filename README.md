- Implementation of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- Hybrid encryption approach combining classical and quantum-resistant methods
- Regular cryptographic agility to adapt to emerging standards

### üîó Bitcoin-Anchored Security
- Leverages Stacks' connection to Bitcoin for enhanced security
- All critical operations settled with Bitcoin's proof-of-work security
- Immutable audit trail of vault operations

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time-Locked Recovery
- Sophisticated recovery mechanisms with customizable time locks
- Multi-signature approval process for recovery attempts
- Dead man's switch functionality with adjustable parameters

### üåâ Cross-Chain Protection
- Asset protection across multiple blockchain ecosystems
- Quantum-resistant signature verification for cross-chain transactions
- Unified security model regardless of underlying blockchain

### üîÑ Inheritance Distribution
- Smart contract-based estate planning for digital assets
- Automated distribution to heirs based on predefined conditions
- Flexible inheritance rules with multi-tiered access controls

## Technical Architecture

QuantumFortress is built on a layered architecture:

1. **Storage Layer**: Secure, encrypted storage using hybrid cryptographic techniques
2. **Contract Layer**: Clarity smart contracts managing access control and business logic
3. **Bridge Layer**: Cross-chain connectivity with standardized security protocols
4. **Interface Layer**: User-friendly management dashboard and recovery tools

## Smart Contracts

- `vault-core.clar`: Primary vault functionality and asset management
- `quantum-sigs.clar`: Implementation of quantum-resistant signature verification
- `timelock.clar`: Time-based access control and recovery logic
- `inheritance.clar`: Legacy planning and automated distribution
- `bridge.clar`: Cross-chain communication and security verification

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core vault functionality and key management
- **Phase 2**: Time-locked recovery mechanisms
- **Phase 3**: Cross-chain bridge development
- **Phase 4**: Inheritance and legacy planning features
- **Phase 5**: Advanced quantum resistance improvements and audits
